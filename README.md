PyBank:
For this part of the challenge we needed to create a code that enables to retrieve the information from a bank.
First I started by calculating how many months where analyzed by creating a list.
Then I sum up the total value of the profit/losses with the sum function.
After that, I needed to iterate to calculate the difference in profit/losses from one month to another and calculate the average change.
To wrap up I just printed out the greatest increase and decrease from the data.

PyPoll:
For the second part of the challenge we needed to analyze a list of votes of an election.
I started by counting the total votes of the election by just adding 1 for each voter.
Then I created a dictionary in which I created a list that contained every candidate name in it.
Then I started to sum up every vote for each candidate and store the results in the dictionary.
After that I printed every candidate's info as requested.
Next I needed to compare every candidate's total votes to determine the winner, I did this by using "if".
After that the results were printed and exported to a text file.
